## Bypass OOBE and need for internet setup with Microsoft account

Open the command prompt at the "Microsoft account" and network setup screens by pressing Shift + F10 (or Shift+Fn+F10), and type ```OOBE\BYPASSNRO```

Your Computer should restart and now will have the "I don't have internet" option visible.
